# TODO LIST

Contacts List
-------------
- *Fix locality editing to use jquery autocomplete instead of the ugly/horrible/slow select*
- Allow localities to be added in address formset (3 levels of fk... _a challenge!_)
- Display full contact detail when editing address, phonenumber, email
- ... or implement inline editing for address/email/phone (better)
- Fix formets to use a better bootstrappy template than django's default .as_li

_Done_

- Show title and nick on contacts list (collapse responsively) - (actually did: glyphicon to represent contact type)
- Manage full address heirarchy when entering/editing address? (actually did: used formsets)
- Add pagination to contacts list page
- Create m2m relations for address, phonenumber, email (actually did: simplified the relational structure)
